# 3D Solar System Representation

Welcome to the Solar System 3D Model project! This interactive 3D representation of the solar system was meticulously developed using Next.js with TypeScript to provide a visually stunning and educationally enriching experience. Dive into an immersive simulation where the celestial dance of our solar system comes to life with accurate planetary rotations, a glowing sun, and the majestic rings of Saturn.

## Features

- **Realistic Solar Representation:** At the heart of our model is a luminous Sun with a bloom effect, creating a glow that mimics the real-life brilliance of our star.
  
- **Saturn's Rings:** A detailed and animated representation of Saturn's rings, showcasing their iconic tilt and rotation.
  
- **Accurate Planetary Orbits:** Each planet orbits the Sun at its 'actual' speed, offering an educational glimpse into the mechanics of our solar system.
  
- **Orbital Paths:** Visible paths that each planet follows around the Sun, enhancing the understanding of celestial movements.
  
- **Speed Adjustment:** A user-friendly speed changer allows you to adjust the orbital velocity of the planets, making it easier or faster to observe their movements around the Sun.
  
- **3D Planetary Rotation:** All planets are not just revolving; theyâ€™re also rotating on their axes, contributing to a more dynamic and realistic simulation.

- **Hover Effects:** When hovering over a planet, its movement stops, and its name is displayed for identification. When the hover ends, the planet resumes its movement from its current position.

- **Click Interaction:** Clicking on a planet displays detailed information about it, including its speed, description, and other relevant data.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before launching the Solar System 3D Model, ensure you have the following requirements met:

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
- Node.js installed on your system for local development and testing.

### Installation

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R1ck404/solar-sytem.git
   cd solar-system
   ```

**Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Run the Project:**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will compile the project and host it on a local web server. You will be provided with a URL to access the Solar System 3D Model in your web browser.

### Navigating the Solar System

- **Zoom in/out:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out for a closer look at the planets or to get an overview of the entire solar system.
- **Pan:** Click and drag the mouse to pan around the space and view the solar system from different angles.
- **Adjust Speed:** Locate the speed control slider on the interface to increase or decrease the orbital speed of the planets.
- **Explore Planetary Details:** Click on any planet to get more information about it.

## Development

This project was developed in a marathon 8-hour coding session, leveraging the power of Next.js with TypeScript for efficient development and maintenance. The primary focus was on achieving a balance between performance and visual fidelity to ensure smooth interactions on most modern devices.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **Three.js:** A powerful JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **WebGL:** The underlying technology that allows Three.js to render graphics in the browser without the need for plugins.
- **JavaScript:** The scripting language used to create dynamic content on the web, powering the interactivity of the Solar System 3D Model.
